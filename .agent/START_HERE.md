# PhantomCommand Agent Start

**Repository:** `LuminaryLabs-Publish/PhantomCommand`

**Last aligned:** `2026-07-09T12-38-16-04-00`

## Purpose

This `.agent/` folder is the repo-local operating memory for scheduled and manual breakdown work on `PhantomCommand`.

Read this folder before changing runtime code.

## Current selection result

The accessible `LuminaryLabs-Publish` organization repo list was compared against `LuminaryLabs-Dev/LuminaryLabs` repo-ledger entries and sampled repo-local `.agent` state.

No checked non-Cavalry Publish repo was fully new, absent from central tracking, missing root `.agent` state, recently added but undocumented, or otherwise undocumented.

`LuminaryLabs-Publish/TheCavalryOfRome` remains excluded by standing rule.

`PhantomCommand` was selected as the oldest eligible central-ledger fallback among the checked non-Cavalry repos. Its central ledger still pointed at `2026-07-09T10-29-02-04-00`, while the other checked non-Cavalry repos had more recent central pointers.

This pass keeps runtime code unchanged and refreshes the next implementation target around live sourceProfile consumer sync, DOM-free fixture proof, additive `GameHost` readback, fixture-before-build gating, and construct-result deferral.

## Current product read

`PhantomCommand` is a static Vite/Three.js construct proof with two routes:

```txt
index.html
  -> game.html
  -> inline Three.js smooth-ring-handoff-v6 construct runtime
```

The visible construct scene is stable and should not be rewritten first.

The live construct still keeps its source constants, ring math, piece math, construct timeline, HUD mutation, camera control, and `GameHost` state inside `game.html`.

## Current interaction loop

```txt
open index.html
  -> menu renders Phantom Command route controls
  -> Start or Open Scene routes to game.html
  -> game.html imports Three.js from CDN
  -> inline runtime creates renderer, scene, fog, lights, camera, HUD, materials, and input state
  -> inline constants define smooth-ring-handoff-v6
  -> inline ring math creates 10 no-gap rings
  -> inline ringParts() computes [5,5,5,5,6,8,10,12,16,20]
  -> inline wedge geometry creates 92 stone pieces
  -> construct(seq) animates each piece by ring delay and part delay
  -> WASD/arrows pan, wheel zooms, Space/Skip jumps to completion, R/Restart resets
  -> HUD reports constructed count, phase, build id, and progress
  -> window.GameHost exposes skipConstruct(), restartConstruct(), and getState()
```

## Next target loop

```txt
source-owned smooth-ring-handoff-v6 profile
  -> normalized profile
  -> ring descriptors
  -> piece descriptors
  -> timeline descriptors
  -> source fingerprint
  -> source snapshot
  -> profile parity report
  -> DOM-free source-profile fixture rows
  -> additive GameHost sourceProfile diagnostics
  -> legacy GameHost compatibility check
  -> game.html sourceProfile consumer readback
  -> npm build runs fixture before static copy
  -> central ledger latest-tracker parity row
  -> construct result and scenario bootstrap remain blocked until source parity passes
```
