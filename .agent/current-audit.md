# PhantomCommand Current Audit

**Timestamp:** `2026-07-08T14-08-24-04-00`

## Summary

`PhantomCommand` is a playable static two-route proof: `index.html` is the menu and `game.html` is the live Three.js construct scene.

The visible construct proof is stable enough to preserve. The current technical risk is still source authority: the live `smooth-ring-handoff-v6` profile, ring descriptors, piece descriptors, timeline descriptors, HUD mutation, and GameHost projection are all inline in `game.html`.

This pass keeps runtime files unchanged and narrows the next implementation ledge into an exact source-profile module and fixture map.

```

No checked non-Cavalry Publish repo was fully new, central-ledger absent, undocumented, recently added but undocumented, or missing root `.agent/START_HERE.md` state.

`PhantomCommand` was selected because its previous root alignment was the oldest sampled eligible entry and its source profile, descriptor parity, construct completion result, and scenario bootstrap gate remain unresolved.

## Current interaction loop

```txt
open index.html
  -> main menu renders title, subtitle, Start button, and Open Scene link
  -> Start or Open Scene routes to game.html
  -> game.html imports Three.js from CDN
  -> inline runtime creates renderer, scene, camera, fog, lights, materials, HUD, and input state
  -> inline constants define smooth-ring-handoff-v6
  -> inline ring math creates 10 no-gap construct rings
  -> inline ringParts() computes [5,5,5,5,6,8,10,12,16,20]
  -> inline wedge geometry creates 92 stone pieces
  -> construct(seq) animates each piece by ring delay and part delay
  -> WASD/arrows pan the camera
  -> mouse wheel zooms
  -> Space/Skip jumps to complete
  -> R/Restart restarts
  -> HUD reports constructed count, phase, build id, and progress
  -> window.GameHost exposes skipConstruct(), restartConstruct(), and getState()
```

## Main architectural read

The repo already has a generic construct scheduling kit and smoke test, but the live `game.html` proof does not yet consume a source-owned PhantomCommand profile.

The next implementation should not start RTS gameplay or rewrite rendering. It should create deterministic, DOM-free source-profile, descriptor, fingerprint, snapshot, parity, and GameHost diagnostic modules that reproduce the live v6 values. Construct event reducers and scenario bootstrap gates should come after the source-profile fixture passes.
